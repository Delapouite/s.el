# s.el [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/magnars/s.el.png)](http://travis-ci.org/magnars/s.el)

The long lost Emacs string manipulation library.

## Warning

This is so much a work in progress that you should definitely not be using it yet.

## Functions

[[ function-list ]]

## Documentation and examples

[[ function-docs ]]

## Development

Run the tests with

    ./run-tests.sh

Create the docs with

    ./create-docs.sh

I highly recommend that you install these as a pre-commit hook, so that
the tests are always running and the docs are always in sync:

    cp pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit

Oh, and don't edit `README.md` directly, it is auto-generated.
Change `readme-template.md` or `examples-to-docs.el` instead.
